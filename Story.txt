In the small town of Raesfeld, a curious tourist named Jack decided to start his day by visiting a local Baeckerei to try their famous Apfelkuchen.
While savoring the delicious cake, he noticed a Hund wearing sunglasses, confidently strutting down the Hauptstrasse like it owned the place.
Intrigued, Jack followed the dog, which led him to a lively Biergarten, where a man dressed in Lederhose was attempting to eat a massive Bratwurst in one bite.
Suddenly, a group of musicians appeared, blasting Rammstein songs while balancing on unicycles near a majestic Schloss, causing everyone in the Biergarten to cheer as they raised their Bratwurst and Brot in celebration
Jack joined the excitement until a mysterious woman in a Dirndel approached him and handed him a flyer for the annual wettbewerbsfaehig pastry competition.

The challenge was to make the perfect Gebaeck, but Jack had no idea how to bake, so he decided to improvise with leftover pieces of Brot and apple slices.

During the judging, chaos broke out when someone spilled beer from their BMW, and it rolled into a table, knocking over all the pastries.

To calm his burning mouth, he wandered into a hidden room in the castle where the air was refreshingly cool thanks to a vintage Klimaanlage.
