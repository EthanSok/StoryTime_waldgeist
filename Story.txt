In the small town of Raesfeld, a curious tourist named Jack decided to start his day by visiting a local Baeckerei to try their famous Apfelkuchen.

While savoring the delicious cake, he noticed a Hund wearing sunglasses, confidently strutting down the Hauptstrasse like it owned the place.

Intrigued, Jack followed the dog, which led him to a lively Biergarten, where a man dressed in Lederhose was attempting to eat a massive Bratwurst in one bite.

Suddenly, a group of musicians appeared, blasting Rammstein songs while balancing on unicycles near a majestic Schloss, causing everyone in the Biergarten to cheer as they raised their Bratwurst and Brot in celebration

Jack joined the excitement until a mysterious woman in a Dirndel approached him and handed him a flyer for the annual wettbewerbsfaehig pastry competition.
